# Abstract

Obesity is a metabolic disorder closely associated with profound alterations in gut microbial composition. However, the dynamics of species composition and
functional changes in the gut microbiome in obesity remain to be comprehensively investigated. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of metagenomic sequencing data from both obese and non-obese individuals across multiple cohorts, totaling 1351 fecal metagenomes. Our results demonstrate a significant decrease in both the richness and diversity of the gut bacteriome and virome in obese patients. We identified 38 bacterial species including *Eubacterium sp*. CAG:274, *Ruminococcus gnavus*, *Eubacterium eligens* and *Akkermansia muciniphila,* and 1 archaeal species, *Methanobrevibacter smithii*, that were significantly altered in obesity. Additionally, we observed altered abundance of five viral families:  *Mesyanzhinovviridae*, *Chaseviridae*, Salasmaviridae*, *Drexlerviridae*, and *Casjensviridae*. Functional analysis of the gut microbiome indicated distinct signatures associated to obesity and identified *Ruminococcus gnavus* as the primary driver for function enrichment in obesity, and *Methanobrevibacter smithii*, *Akkermansia muciniphila*, *Ruminococcus bicirculans*, and *Eubacterium siraeum* as functional drivers in the healthy control group. Additionally, our results suggest that antibiotic resistance genes and bacterial virulence factors may influence the development of obesity. Finally, we demonstrated that gut vOTUs achieved a powerful diagnostic accuracy with an optimal area under the curve of 0.766 for distinguishing obesity from healthy controls. Our findings offer comprehensive and generalizable insights into the gut bacteriome and virome features associated with obesity, with the potential to guide the development of microbiome-based diagnostics.
