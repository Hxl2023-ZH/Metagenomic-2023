#Abstract

The gut microbiota plays an essential role in a wide range of host related process and chronic diseases in humans. Species composition and functional changes in the human gut microbial community are significantly associated with obesity. However, a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the obesity and gut microbiome is still lacking. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of metagenomics sequencing data of the gut microbiome in obese and non-obese sample from multiple cohorts considering in total 862 fecal metagenomes. Our results revealed that the gut bacterial and viral richness and diversity are both significantly decreased in obese patients. 48 bacterial species including Eubacterium sp CAG_274, Ruminococcus gnavus, Eubacterium_eligens and Akkermansia muciniphila, and 5 viral families including Mesyanzhinovviridae, Chaseviridae, Salasmaviridae, Drexlerviridae and Casjensviridae were identified to be significantly altered in obesity. Functional analysis of the gut bacteriome uncovered functional signatures that related to obesity, and also found the Ruminococcus gnavus as the main driver for function enrichment in obesity, and the Methanobrevibacter smithii, Akkermansia muciniphila, Ruminococcus bicirculans and Eubacterium siraeum for the functional driver in lean groups. Also, our results suggest that antibiotic resistance genes and bacterial virulence factors may influence the development of obesity. Finally, we showed that the gut viral vOTUs achieved a powerful diagnostic accuracy with optimal area under the curve of 0.766 for discriminating obesity from lean controls. Our results established a comprehensive and generalizable gut bacteriome and virome features associated with obesity, which will contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between gut microbes and obesity, and may be useful for the development of microbiome-based diagnostics.
